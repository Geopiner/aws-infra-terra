# Daily Log - 2025-08-21

- Migrated all infrastructure definitions into modules for cleaner, reusable, and scalable Terraform code.
- Removed redundant resources from root (vpc.tf, ec2.tf, iam.tf) and moved logic into modules/vpc, modules/ec2, and modules/iam.
- Updated root main.tf to orchestrate modules only, passing variables and outputs without duplicating module calls.
- Moved AMI data sources (aws_ssm_parameter + aws_ami) to root so ec2 module receives ami_id as a variable.
- Refactored EC2 module to remove internal module calls; it now only manages the EC2 resource itself.
- Cleaned Terraform references to ensure all subnet_id, security_group_id, and IAM instance profiles are passed from root to modules.
- Eliminated previous conflicts and redundancy in subnet creation and route table associations by centralizing network resources in the VPC module.

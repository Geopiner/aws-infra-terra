- Bootstrapped foundational AWS infrastructure using Terraform: created VPC, subnet, internet gateway, route table, and security groups to establish network and security baseline.
- Deployed EC2 instance with an IAM role and instance profile to securely manage permissions without embedding credentials.
- Replaced broad AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy with a custom scoped IAM policy tailored to EC2 SSM access for better security and least privilege.
- Installed and verified AWS SSM Agent on the instance to enable secure, passwordless management and shell access via Session Manager.
- Tested and confirmed SSM Session Manager connectivity using AWS CLI, ensuring hands-free, auditable instance management.
- Added useful Terraform outputs (public IP, instance ID, instance profile) to facilitate easy access and integration.
- Structured Terraform files cleanly for modularity and scalability, preparing for more complex infra in future.
- Validated instance access both via SSH and SSM, confirming multi-method management capabilities.
